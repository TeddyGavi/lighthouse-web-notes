### Focusing on read line and stretch 
- i spent most of the day focusing on async stretch problems
- one things i ran into was trying to get the realine interface to work correctly with the std in and std out 
- i need to work more on this
- essentially the readline is just a wrapper function for the in/out of std module that is included with node
- it allows to to take input in from the command line given certain prompts,
- this also allows us to use async functions and the readfile module for example to read a write to a particular file
