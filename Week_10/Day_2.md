### Lecture on SASS and Responsive design
- responsive design involves making sure the design looks good across multiple screen sizes


### Absolute versus relative units
- important to understand the difference 
- pixels are absolute but behave relative to the display
- relative values are often in association with the parent element important to remember when dealing with elements that don't have a defined property for a rule that you are trying to reference
- viewport is an important value as you are able to control properties based on the screen size
- em is relative to the parent, rem is relative to the root element
- Can use media queries to control breakpoints in your design,
- ie, a different screen size will force a new layout
- SASS is a preprocessor for CSS
- it allows for use of variables, nesting, mixins(like functions in js), and inheritance 
- becomes very useful for defining global variables and repeatedly used CSS rules
