### Working on tweeter
- not much came up here except refactoring css into SASS is tough as i nested a lot of elements the over qualification became an issue
- SASS is so much better!
- SASS uses , variables, functions (@mixins), inheritance and nesting!
- it is a preprocessor, which adds a bit to the set up but it also allows for much simpler writing I wish i would've started the project with SASS
- some things that did come up was the fact that scroll to didn't have a callback built into it, I had to write my own!
- the error handling isn't ideal but it is functional and I want to keep moving forward here as I am getting a bit behind spending so much time on this!
