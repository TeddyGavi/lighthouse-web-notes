# This week is all about ruby

- everything is an Object
- we can use .class to see what the type of an object is
- we use blocks and def end to set up functions
- class and modules are use extensively
- we can think of modules as mixins which can be use to "mix into" another class which allows us to reuse functions across multiple classes
