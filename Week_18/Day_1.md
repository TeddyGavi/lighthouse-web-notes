- I am going back in time here as i didn't take notes

- some important things were useEffect and how it creates a side effect
  - data fetching is an async operation and creates a timeout op so therefore we need to manage this "Effect"
- using axios returns a json formatted object
- we also set up the api server and wrote a custom hook
- Wasn't really much else to say in this week
