### Studying all day for exam!
- keys to remember is that almost everything is a callback!
- promise syntax 
- readFile and request became very important
- remember how to filter out duplicates in an array
  > array.filter((e, i, a) => a.indexOf(e) === i)
- remember that most async functions fall into
> request(url,(err, response) => {....})
- this can be wrapped in a function which will also take a callback
- settimeout function
> setTimeout(()=>{}, delay)
-
