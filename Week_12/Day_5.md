### DATA structures
- data is everything!
- one common data structure revolves around a "tree" concept
- each data point in the tree is a node
- each connecting branch is a edge
- each node is connected to the root node (the base of the tree)
- tree traversal! yikes
  > three major concepts for traversing
  - Preorder, inOrder, postorder

  1. Preorder
  - < root > < left > < right >
  2. Inorder
  - < left > < root > < right >
  - IMPORTANT! this actually gives you a sorted listed (for a binary tree)
  3. postorder
  - < left > < right > < root >
