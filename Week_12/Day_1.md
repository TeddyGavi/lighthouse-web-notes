### MORE DATABASE Design
- fist normal form
- no repeating values
- no rows containing multiple keys
- The foreign key is on the many side. The foreign key is on the many side. The foreign key is on the many side.
- There are no direct many to many relationships
- only multiple one to many relationships
- Its very important to model the database with an ERD before beginning any code
- need to ask yourself important questions about how to store the data.
  - do we need one to many? many to many?
  - do we want to create an PK for a joining table
  - how many entities do we need?
  - are we creating a store, a class list, a pet list, each of these will have different requirements
  - ultimately there is no right or wrong, it will depend on the importance of each entity as determined by who you are working with.
  

### some conventions on naming
- use snake_case
- plural table names,
- single column names
- call your primary key id
- for foreign tables call the FK <table>_id
