### This week is the first week of holidays

- I am trying to get through all the week 24 and 25 material so i can be ahead come time when we go back to class
- I would rather be working on my other projects

## Rails and Ruby

- rails is a complicated framework that works to simplify the creation of apps
- some things to note are the fact that most of views, controllers and even models that we need to create are able to be created by using the generate command
- it does save a lot of time and rather than going into each folder and creating the files separately rails does this for us

- I am not sure about active record as it is essentially a "shorthand" for writing SQL
- the syntax is new and I am not sure how to do many things
- simple queries are easy of course but things get awkward when you need to join multiple tables and order them in a specific order, it will take some time to get used to it
