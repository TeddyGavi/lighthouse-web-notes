## Working with migrations

- this is a fancy way to say hey, lets update the database
- Maybe we want to add a new feature or we wants to add a new column to the original database that we forgot, the migrate allows us to update the database as needed
- I can see this being very useful, because during our midterm when we needed to change something in the db we had to recreate the whole database and all the records
- I am not sure this would be a good idea on a production level, there are so many records and data being stored i believe it would cause issues and that is not something that we want to deal with on a production level
