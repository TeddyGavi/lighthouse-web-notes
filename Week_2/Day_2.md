### Objects and Arrays 
- arrays are ordered
- ordered by the index, which can be thought of as the 'key'
- functions inside a object are called methods
- the ```this``` keyword works by referencing a key in the object you are currently in when working with methods
- Pass-By-Value
> this means that the value that is to say that the arugement passed into a function is a copy
- pass-by-reference 
> objects however, can be passed by reference which means they can be changed, the reference is a pointer to the object
> when you make a change to the object you are actually changing the object itself
- objects have mutable properties
- everything is a primitive type, except functions and objects and arrays but arrays and functions ARE objects
1. string
2. number/bigint
3. null
4. undefinded 
5. boolean
6. symbol

- higher order functions are functions that accept another function as an arguement or they return a function
- higher order functions operate on another function;
