### Objects
- working through social network and calculate tax
- I found that the ```forEach()``` method was extremetly useful
dont forget about ```includes()``` it is also extremely powerful
-  i was chaining functions together on varaiables with dot notation
- remeber that to access a variable inside a loop when dealing with objects we need to use 
> square brackets
- the ```sort()``` function is very powerful also, can be used to sort numbers and objects and strings, 
> remeber that the default sorting algorithm is lexigraphical, which means every value is converted into a alpahbetical value

- JavaScript will retain the context of parent functions, meaning that it will retain references to any variables in parent functions this is referred to as Lexical Scoping.
> When a function retains the context of a parent function, we call that a "closure".
- essentially closures allow functions defined inside functions to have access to the outer variables, as all functions have access to anything outside their scope
