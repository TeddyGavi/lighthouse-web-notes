### Objects
- working through social network and calculate tax
- I found that the ```forEach()``` method was extremetly useful
dont forget about ```includes()``` it is also extremely powerful
-  i was chaning functions together on varaiables with dot notation
- remeber that to access a variable inside a loop when dealing with objects we need to use 
> square brackets
