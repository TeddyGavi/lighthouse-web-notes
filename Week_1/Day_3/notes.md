### Functions
- a pure function is what?
> has no side effects but also doesn't rely on side effects from other code
- give your functions precise and descriptive names

- functions should focus on a single task, if you are trying to do to much with one function break it into smaller functions

1. give your functions percise and action based names
2. use camelCase
3. properly indent
4. Functions should focus on a single task
5. Break your function into smaller functions if it is focusing on two or more things
