# Again catch up

- this week had us work on our resumes a bit
- we also handled errors and create a put/delete request when an interview was booked or deleted
- we had some stretch activities introduced
- an important concept here was the case against switch statements
- i created a reducer that follow the pattern of an object and each key would return a anonymous function
- this creates a much simpler and easier to read syntax
- also doesn't allow for some the pitfalls of using switch, if you misplace the brackets or if you forget
