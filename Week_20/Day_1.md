# TESTING

- the next two weeks are all about testing
- We can think of testing in levels
  -static testing
  - linting or using a statically typed language ie TYPESCRIPT
- unit testing
  - this is testing functions and components in isolation
    -Integration
- this involves testing components that are meant to work together, do
- often involves mocking data
- E2E
- this can be done with cypress as an example
- we want to make the end to end testing as close to real world as possible.

- TDD is important and vital and a lot easier to use in the beginning of a project then trying to go back and work on thousands of lines of code
