### Lecture notes
- HTTP is stateless
- there are pros and cons to this statement
- but it essentially means we have to send information about the user with every request and response
- cookies are used for this purpose
- track data and record user preferences
- we need to use a cookie parser in order to read the data store in the cookie
- similar to how we used a body parser to read the data stored in the body of any response header
