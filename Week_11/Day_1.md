### All about the Database
- Databases fall into two main categories
- relational and non relational
  - relational contain multiple tables that are linked
  - allow searching and CRUD operations
  - most prevalent are relational
- non relational are simply flat tables

- A large part of DB building is avoid duplicates
- ERD, entity relationship diagram
- Entity, tribute, relationship, cardinality

- entity 
> a person place or thing
> a container 
- a tribute
> individual instances of each entity
- usually listed with a PK, a primary key
- relationship
> how entities are linked
> a verb
> ie a student has a phone number

- cardinality
> this is the most difficult to understand
> [crows foot notation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-diagram-with-crow-s-foot-database-notation-1ec22af9-3bd3-4354-b2b5-ed5752af6769)

> this is the count of instances that are allowed or are necessary for entity relationships
