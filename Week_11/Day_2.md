### Lecture 
- Maui spoke about what a database is and why it is needed
- key takeaways are the scalability, reusability, security and ability to work on each section of your application in a modular manner
- Entities are perhaps the most important concept
- and EVERYTHING is a table
- with SQL we are basically writing Queries to gain access to different row and columns that contain certain data that we would like to retrieve
- pgADmin is an ui that we can download to interact with DB and build our own DB
- its important to remember that databases become powerful due to the relationships that we can create. 
- this is made possible by linking separate tables through PK and FK
- primary keys and foreign keys
- primary keys are establish inside the root entity where foreign keys are keys that reference other tables
- these are generally built in a serial way
- there are multiple commands to know and get familiar with for working with SQL
- some of the more important commands are
> CREATE TABLE
> SELECT ... FROM
> JOIN
> WHERE
> ORDER BY
> GROUP BY
