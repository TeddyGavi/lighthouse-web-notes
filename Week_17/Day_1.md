# All the last two weeks were working on the midterm, lots of things were learned but now we are onto React

## What is React?
- library for building interactive UI's
- using components, state, props
- using JSX which is Js xml

## JSX is more strict than HTML

### rule 1
- use two tags
- use one self closing

### Rule 2
- a child tag must close before its parents
-
### Rule 3
- all JSX expressions must end in one root level element

### Rule 4
- no HTML comments, comments must be made {/*....*/}

- ReactDOM.render is normally done once per application

### React event handlers
- the main event handles are on click, submit and change

### Data structuring is important
- do we use an array!? if order is important then yes,
- do we need to change values often? use an object
- determine what data you need
- determine what operations you need to perform on the data
organize the data
- is certain data independent or related ?
- start small and grow
