### React Tooling

#### Webpack
- creates a bundle that the browser can understand
- the biggest issue is that module exporting and importing are not supported across all browsers

#### Storybook
- this allows us to test ui components in an isolated environment and find edge cases and errors
- storybook requires some learning curve and there are many advanced features that we aren't going into on the this first project
- 

#### JEST
- jest is an automated testing environment that runs in the command line
- used for TDD
- most of the tests are already written in the interview scheduler for us? at least it seems?
