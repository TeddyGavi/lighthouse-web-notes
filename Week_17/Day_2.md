### lecture on React
- fragments!
- use only <> and </> if you do not need to pass any props to the component
- JSX can only have one parent element, so sometimes it is needed to use a fragment
- we don't always wants to clutter up the DOM with not needed divs
- unnecessary divs can also add to strange bugs with CSS

### Forms
- when using forms, the HTML element keeps track of its own values, but in React it is better to use Reacts state to set and update the vales of html form elements

 ### CSS in React
 - 4 different ways
  - inline styling
  - component linked stylesheet
  - css modules
  - Styled-components (or other libraries)
