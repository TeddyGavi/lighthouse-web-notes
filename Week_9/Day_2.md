### Ajax
- not a programming lang
- uses a combination of built in XMLHTTP requests to get data from the server
- you can then use HTTP requests nd the DOM to display and manipulate data
- XML used to be the standard object, no it is more common to use JSON objects
- now we use AJAX to deal with JSON objects, or potentially a string


### How to use
- first load HTML and js and css
- inside js we can define the tools/library to use, import if necessary through CDN (content delivery network)
- next, think about what trigger will fire the request, usually a DOM event.
- send a request, then update the website
- 

### How to use an api
- use public API on gitHub
- will show use many different free APIs and how to use/auth
- use a http client like postman or insomnia or hopscotch

#### use the fetch api
- this is using vanilla js and using the document api
- fetch is a promised based request


### We can use jQuery via a CDN
- add a link into the html
- add a vendor folder and add jQuery into the folder
