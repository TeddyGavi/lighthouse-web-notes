### Exam day!

- really struggled with recursion solutions
- the last problem in particular i really had a hard time to figure out what to do
- I probably could've used the modulo operator to see if the byte was divisible by 1000 and then kept track of how many times it was divisible using a recursive solution to get the base case of 1 byte, stopping here, and then returning the counter linked with to an object with that base
- instead what I did is i made a object that corresponded to the suffix needed and used Log10 to see what the answer was
- then i split up the remaining cases by hardcoding the answers
- ie, 1 or less than 100 (which probably would've been the same on the recursion)
