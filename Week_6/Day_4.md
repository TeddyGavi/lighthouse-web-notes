### Lecture today with Bryan
- went over creating a server with express
- adding and modifying a simple pokemon database
- we also created simple ejs pages working with html forms and buttons
- this allowed us to create specific http request to certain routes on the server (express side)
- we looked at some middleware, including morgan and the JSON body parser 
- which will take the plain text version of JSON and convert it into a javascript object that we can work with easier
