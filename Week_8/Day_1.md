### CSS
- flexbox!
- flexbox assigns the parent container the property of flex, which now we can use to align the childern with certain key: value properties
- css specificity is important
- tags are worth 1, classes are worth 10, ids are worth 100, !important and inline styling is worth 1000 
- the cascade allows rules written after others to override those that come before. 
- certain properties are also inherited
