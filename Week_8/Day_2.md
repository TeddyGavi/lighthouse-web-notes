### Lecture with Maui
- WE covered a lot today!
- HTML recap,
- HTML semantic tags, tags that give meaning for screen readers and also for other developers working on the same code
- almost all elements are display with block
- some elements are displayed with inline
- dev tools are very important when troubleshooting CSS and html as we can see how the DOM is rendered and how the elements are being displayed
- we can quickly change styling and test out different layouts inside the dev tools

### CSS box model
- everything is a box!
- a box is made up of content, wrapped by padding, wrapped by border then a margin
- it is typical to use a reset to make everything appear in a uniform manner across all browsers
- meyerweb is a popular reset
