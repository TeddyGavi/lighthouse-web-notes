### jQuery
- essentially this is a faster way to access and modify elements of the dom
- a nice wrapper for js
- a lot of older projects use this

### SVG versus PNG
- svg is scalable vector graphics
- alot better for icons as the image quality is not lost when you change the size of the screen
- png is better for high quality images and can display details very well
- svg is difficult to modify with css and HTML
