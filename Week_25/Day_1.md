### This week is all about research and reflect

## I am going to research into linked lists data structures

# notes

- a linked list contains a node within a linked list
- each node contains data and a pointer associated with it
- there are some advantages and disadvantages to using linked lists over arrays
- an array is a way of storing several values in memory

  - they can be accessed by the index very fast O(1)

- a linked list starts off with no data, and the pointer points to nothing.
- each node has a pointer! this means that the nodes can be stored anywhere in memory and are referenced by the pointers or the next value
- the end of the linked list is NULL
- if you need to add or remove an element into the beginning of the linked list this is constant time, and in certain applications this can be ideal
  - forward and back in a browser or image viewer (doubly linked)
- insert and delete are 0(1) constant time
- where as prepend is O()

- structure of article should be something like
- intro
- what is a linked list
- other options (doubly linked lists etc)
- compare to arrays
  - advantages and disadvantages
- applications
- write some code
  - outline the basic structure
  - prepend,
  - append
  - delete
  - update
  - print
  - sum all?
    - compare speed to arrays
