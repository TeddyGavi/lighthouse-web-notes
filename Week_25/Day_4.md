### Career Services lecture

Tell me about yourself?

I am a self-proclaimed renaissance man. I have many interests, from juggling, to mountain biking, hiking, to philosophy.

I am a full Stack Web Developer transitioning from the Electrical industry.

I have a B.Sc in Biology from the University of Saskatchewan and during my time there I studied basic computer science and wrote simple c++. This basic introduction has always been a source of inspiration throughout my life. When I became a father I was given the final push I needed to pursue my career in tech, driven by a foundation in CS and to provide my family with future opportunities, I decided to enroll in the LHL Web Flex program. I studied JavaScript, React, Node and Ruby on Rails and now I am excited to work for ******\_****** (companyâ€™s name) and pursue ****\_**** (given technology or app)
