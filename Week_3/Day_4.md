### this was a test day no lecture
- i didn't take many notes
- some tips for recurison however
> try to come up with a solution to the simplest portion of the problem
- test that solution against other simple solutions
> take a leap of faith that by calling the function it will work regardless of the complexity of the problem
- the towers of hanoi are a great example
- I need to go over recursion and creating new object classes.
