- important info about the model view controller pattern
- deep dive beginning into the Ruby on Rails
- first thoughts are how large the application is
- the integration of the db inside the app combined with erb files will take some time to get a handle on
- i think the layout is pretty confusing compared to Next.js
- although Next.js doesn't have integrated with Active Record
- Most of the work is done in the app folder
- the views are erb files that display dynamic data
- the controller sends the info from the db to the views
- that is the model, the db
- the controller can be seen as a middle man, or project manager
- it communicates between the views and the model
