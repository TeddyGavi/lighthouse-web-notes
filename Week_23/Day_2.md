### Lecture about project planning

- Waterfall development
- Agile development

- waterfall follows a sequence of planned steps but its also important to be flexible and sometimes you need to move backward and forward in your project to get the desired results
- SCRUM, EXTREME PROGRAMMING, KANBAN and LEAN DEVELOPMENT
- usually faster to get a project working, but it also welcomes changes, which means traditional projects end up costing more
-

## Scrum

- All based on sprints, essentially a time constraint to work on a feature or project
- usually two week sprints are common
- continuous deployment happens at the end of each sprint
- scrum master is always talking to the product manager and they in turn are talking to the interested parties
- After the sprint is done, you chose from the product backlog
- Daily meetings are usually 15 mins - 30 mins and we check in

## Kanban

- essentially the to do list
- like the trello board
  - to do, doing, done

# sometimes scrum and kanban are mixed

## Extreme Programming

- focus very little on planning or meetings
- only have a shell of a plan and then go straight into programming
- very simple testing
- best for simple projects

## Lean development

- closely related to the waterfall method
- good for long term projects
- comes from lean manufacturing with Toyota
- always optimizing

## Iron triangle

- cost, time, scope
- scope, schedule, resource
