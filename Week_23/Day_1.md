### More Ruby and active record

- one thing to mention is that I had a meeting with Maui to look over my math game
- important to keep all class methods together, so for example, i had to move the player name and asking question methods into their own respective classes
- well not 100% needed it was good becuase it allowed easier reading of the game glass
- this way the player and the question classes managed their own state and behaviors
